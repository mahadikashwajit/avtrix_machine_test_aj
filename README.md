git clone

install requirements.txt(create virtualenv if needed)

locate manage.py file and do "python manage.py runserver".

I have added some of data already using file.

Also adding SQLite3 file so user will able to access data directly.

Task 1 = Use django import export model from Django Admin Panel(I have added file Products.xlsx in repo).
Task 2 = Get with search option -> http://localhost:8000/products/?search=arrow -> search is query parameter(you can use desired search value by product name).
Task 3 = Post with seatch option -> http://localhost:8000/products/post/ -> In request body pass {"search" : "value to search product by name"}.
